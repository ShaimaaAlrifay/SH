-- ============================================================
-- Areep — Phase 1 schema (Auth + Projects + Dashboard)
--
-- Run this in Supabase: Dashboard → SQL Editor → New query → paste
-- this whole file → Run. Later phases (discovery sessions, messages,
-- requirements, PRDs, exports) add their own tables in separate
-- migration files — this one only covers what Phase 1 needs.
--
-- Auth itself needs no table here — Supabase already provides
-- `auth.users`; every table below just references it.
-- ============================================================

-- ---------- organizations ----------
-- Every user gets one organization automatically on signup (see the
-- trigger at the bottom) — this is what makes "Business/Teams" in
-- later phases a straightforward extension instead of a rewrite.
create table if not exists organizations (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  name text not null,
  owner_id uuid references auth.users(id) on delete cascade not null,
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);

-- ---------- organization_members ----------
-- Membership table, not just organizations.owner_id, so multi-user
-- teams (Section 45's "Business" tier) slot in later without
-- touching this table's shape — just insert more rows.
create table if not exists organization_members (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  organization_id uuid references organizations(id) on delete cascade not null,
  user_id uuid references auth.users(id) on delete cascade not null,
  role text not null default 'owner' check (role in ('owner', 'admin', 'member')),
  created_at timestamptz default now(),
  unique (organization_id, user_id)
);

-- ---------- clients ----------
create table if not exists clients (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  organization_id uuid references organizations(id) on delete cascade not null,
  name text not null,
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);

-- ---------- projects ----------
create table if not exists projects (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  organization_id uuid references organizations(id) on delete cascade not null,
  client_id uuid references clients(id) on delete set null,
  name text not null,
  project_type text not null default 'other'
    check (project_type in ('mobile_app','web_app','saas','ecommerce','internal_system','marketplace','landing_page','dashboard','api_backend','other')),

  status text not null default 'discovery'

  discovery_progress int not null default 0 check (discovery_progress between 0 and 100),

create index if not exists clients_org_idx on clients (organization_id);

-- ---------- updated_at auto-touch ----------
create or replace function touch_updated_at() returns trigger as $$
begin
  new.updated_at = now();
  return new;
end;
$$ language plpgsql;

drop trigger if exists projects_touch_updated_at on projects;
create trigger projects_touch_updated_at
  before update on projects
  for each row execute function touch_updated_at();

-- ---------- new-user bootstrap ----------
-- Every signup gets its own organization automatically (named after
-- their email until they rename it) — the dashboard/project pages
-- can then assume `organization_members` always has at least one row
-- for the logged-in user, no "no org yet" edge case to handle in UI.
create or replace function handle_new_user() returns trigger as $$
declare
  new_org_id uuid;
begin
  insert into organizations (name, owner_id)
  values (coalesce(split_part(new.email, '@', 1), 'My Organization'), new.id)
  returning id into new_org_id;

  insert into organization_members (organization_id, user_id, role)
  values (new_org_id, new.id, 'owner');

  return new;
end;
$$ language plpgsql security definer set search_path = public;
-- `set search_path = public` matters here: this trigger fires from inside
-- Supabase's auth service (GoTrue), whose calling role doesn't have `public`
-- in its default search_path — without this, the unqualified table names
-- above silently fail to resolve and signup dies with a generic
-- "Database error saving new user" (confirmed live).

drop trigger if exists on_auth_user_created on auth.users;
create trigger on_auth_user_created
  after insert on auth.users
  for each row execute function handle_new_user();

-- ============================================================
-- Row Level Security — every table locked down by default,
-- opened up only to rows the requesting user's organization(s)
-- actually own. This is what makes it safe to call Supabase
-- directly from the frontend with the public anon key.
